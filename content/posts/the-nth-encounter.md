It's been ages after [the first encounter](/the-first-encounter). Changed schools. Moved to a new school that doesn't care about computers. That love story ended more quickly than I thought and there's nothing much I could have done about it.

Years passed by. Back to cramming subjects for marks and going on. Somehow, that cramming got me some good marks in school and parents were happy about it. Those good marks convinced my parents to get a computer. But by that time, I was over that first love story (how computers work) and instead was more interested in playing GTA Vice City, the second love story (playing games). What else a computer is good for if not for playing games. And then one after another, just play.

That daily play quickly became boring and not that exciting. I always wanted to do more of Automobile engineering, who doesn't love fast moving cars (of course I've become a F1 Fan now), but Universe has other plans for me. Instead, made me choose CS. Not a bad plan, Universe, I say now, but I didn't know it back then.

Was at my relatives place, playing Midtown madness on PC. Took a quick break and reviewing the bookshelf. Something caught my attention. "Let Us C" by "Yeshwanth Kanethkar". I have no clue what it is about and I still wonder why it caught my attention. They let me borrow the book. Them or myself little did know that this is going to change my life. This is how it all re-started.

Going through the book, digesting each chapter, solving any exercises/problems that I can find in these chapters. Quickly, done with the book. Waiting for more of these exercises. Then found another book, did the same. Quickly realised, this isn't going to work if I want to keep solving problems (competitive programming problems). Did "Google" search. Found a site called "SPOJ". I was ecstatic. It was one of the best moments of my life, seeing all the huge list of problems that are ready and waiting to be solved in a language of my choice (Back then it was C++).

Love is back in my life. It's not as same as my [first encounter](/the-first-encounter). It's way more than that.
