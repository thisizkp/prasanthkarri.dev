Finally, this is the year they said we will have "Computers" as a subject in school. I'm so excited about Computers. Till then, Computers were something that are only seen in movies and none of my friends/family members have had experience with it. In School, they taught us the definitions of CPU and RAM and few other basic things but nothing more (at least in the beginning). I was just memorizing the definitions so that I can score good marks in the exam and never paid much attention to the inner workings or details of those definitions.

Then the lab time came. They gave us a computer each for few minutes. Finally, witnessed the magic device in person. We have been asked not to type anything except the alphabets/numbers on Keyboard. I've so excitingly typed my name "PRASANTH", searching for each letter on the keyboard and pressed enter. Waited for a little less than a second and it printed out "PRASANTH" back. What magic is this! I've typed out few other words and it printed them to screen (again). I've typed long words and long words came out. I've started doing calculations and it's giving the output of the calculated number instead of just printing the input. I'm so excited and felt as if like this device is talking to me. I was wondering what else can this device can do and that's how the love began.
