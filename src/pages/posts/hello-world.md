Welcome to my blog!. Here, I will share my learning journey as I explore various technologies and concepts.

There's are tonnes of things to learn. I will be using this blog to document my learning journey. By learning in public, I hope to learn faster and better by getting feedback from the community.

## What topics will I be writing about mostly?

I will be mostly be writing about Rust, Distributed Systems, Database Systems, and some Computer Science. I might occasionally delve into other topics as well including but not limited to Essays, Book Reviews and other random thoughts.

If you are interested in following along, do bookmark this site. I will be adding a RSS feed soon.
