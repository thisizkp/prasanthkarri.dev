This is how we usually start our programming journey (at least most of the times), right? "Hello World" helps in getting any boilerplate stuff out of our way before diving into more interesting things.

Respecting the tradition, starting with a "Hello World" blog post. Want to get away from all the boilerplate stuff while getting this blog post live - framework of choice, design, hosting..etc.

Now that they are out of the way (sure, not 100% - as I'll continue tweaking the UI/UX of this site), I could focus more on learning, writing and sharing things here. I hope this will not be the only post on this site.
