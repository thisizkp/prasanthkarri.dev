Hello World!

This is how we usually start our programming journey (at least most of the times), right?. Just tried following the tradition here. But probably need a bit more than just a string.So, here it goes.

I write here about things that I find interesting and things that I'm currently learning about. Note taking is great but writing about things in public is much better. I can finally have a place ([this blog](https://prasanthkarri.dev)) in a corner of the internet where I can play around with tech (used [astro](https://astro.build) to build [this blog](https://prasanthkarri.dev)), meet other interesting people, record my daily learnings (like - today I learned), gather feedback and improve myself.

Earlier I said I write about things that I find interesting. But what are they? It really is a hard question. Hard to pinpoint a particular thing. Don't want to limit myself (at least not yet) to a particular topic. May be one day. So, if you are following now, please be aware that it could be any random topic ranging from programming to how to make a good cup of coffee ☕️.

If you are interested in following along, do bookmark this site or subscribe to the [RSS feed](/rss.xml). You can also reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thisizkp).
